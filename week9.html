        <h1>Week9 Blog</h1>
        <p>
            This week is very busy week. Too many things I need to do, CS261 project, PHYS140L report, CHIN447 paper, and driver license test.
            I don't really want to talk about it, I perpared hard for it, and I even left the class early, but I didn't pass it.
            Ok, I am a man now, I need to accpet this truth that society is cruel, and giving does not mean there is a return.

            My mom asked me to talk with my little brother, becuase he did not eat much thing recently.
            after I talked with him, I found the reason which is he want to lose weight by diet.
            So, I searched many things includes papers and videos for convincing him do it in scientific way.
            Thanks god, he listened to me this time.
