        <h1>Week7 Blog</h1>
        <p>
            This week is a good week. I catched up all my class, submited all late homework. Thanks for all my
            professors give my the chance to do that.
            Ok, time to talk about class. We finished the basic part of this class, and move on to React.
            Before I do my group work with group members, I thought React is good and convenience tool.
            Actually, it is good, but not that convenience as I image.

            One more things is that I finially get out of the last relationship.
            After I have a long phone call with an old friend, I learn to think about the last relationship rationally.
            It is very simple, I just ask myself a few questions, such as "Did her change me, if yes, what is it?".
            Now, I never know that so clearly, if I need to find the next girlfriend, what kind of girl I want.
            What habits are acceptable to me, and what personality is intolerable to me.
            It just like a lesson for my life.
            Every coin has two sides, right?
