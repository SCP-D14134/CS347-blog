            I think I already catch up with the class because I start to type the HTML and CSS code.
            Even what I did is copy the code from the lecture videos, I still feel that I learn something.
            In my opinion, HTML is a strange programming language, because it has three languages.
            For example, JAVA is JAVA, C is C, but for HTML, we need to learn HTML, CSS, and JS.

            That game named "CSS Dinner" is fun, if anyone of my friends starts to learn HTML, I would send the game link to him.
