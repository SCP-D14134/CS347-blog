        <h1>Week1 Blog</h1>
        <p>
            That's my first week of Fall 2020, I have to admit that it is very hard.
            Many things happened, such as the keyboard of my MacBook doesn't work.
            I thought about dropping this course many times because I could not follow up on the class.
            It feels bad when classmates are talking about the lab but I have no idea about HTML and CSS.
            Maybe that's my bad, I should spend some time in summer to prepare the class,
            and this web blog costs a lot of my time to setup.
        </p>

            One more thing is that my new professor never uses canvas, I didn't get used to it at the beginning, because I just needed to check canvas to see what I need to do in the past.
            Whatever, after I talked with him, I decided to stay in this class.
            I seem to hear a voice in my head saying that it’s shameful to run away, don’t be a coward, be a man.
            Maybe I just need to study harder, right?
