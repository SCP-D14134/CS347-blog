            That's my first week of Fall 2020, I have to admit that it is very hard.
            Many things happened, such as the keyboard of my macbook doesn't work.
            I thought about dropping this course many times, becuase I could not follow up the class.
            It feels bad when classmates are talking about the lab but I have no idea about HTML and CSS.
            Maybe that's my bad, I should spend some time on summer to perper the class,
            and this web bolg cost a lot of my time to setup.
            One more thing is that my new professor never use canvas, I didnt get use to it at begining, becuase I just needed to check canvas to see what I need to do in the past.
            Whatever, after I talked with him, I decided to stay in this class.
            I seem to hear a voice in my head saying that it’s shameful to run away, don’t be a coward, be a man.
            Maybe I just need to study harder, right?
