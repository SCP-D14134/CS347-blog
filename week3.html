        <h1>Week3 Blog</h1>
        <p>
            After I got my new MacBook, I shared my screen with the other classmates when we got in the breaking room.
            It was my first time, and I believe it would not be my last time.
            I mean, it was not that hard to do it. I was not nervous like I imagined before.
            Ok, it is time to talk about class. There are too many variables I need to use in the CSS file, and some of them are very similar.
            Yea, I understand that I need to remember all of them, it just needs time.
            One more thing is that I told a joke at beginning of a class.
            Seems like I made it clear because I saw some classmates laughed, and you understood it too.
