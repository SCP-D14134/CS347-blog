            OK, this blog is a late blog. I have to admit that React is harder that I thought before, or maybe I should find the reson from myself.
            I am alreay 24 years old man, but sometime I just blame others first. But, what about now? Should I blame the professor or the creators of React?
            I have not started the project 2. I should catch up the class the start working on it.

            I talked with my father by using facetime. He asked me to go to the graduate school after I get my undergradute degree.
            I thought we have already had the deal before, which is that I find a job and work 3 or 4 years to find the way of my career, 
            then I will go back school, get my graduate to prepare for my career futrue.
            After that arguement, he told me that one of his friends has a daugher, maybe I can meet with her.
            I really think if my father was born a hundred years earlier, he would be very happy, 
            becuase in that time, parents could decide everything for their children.
