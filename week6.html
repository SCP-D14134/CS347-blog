        <h1>Week6 Blog</h1>
        <p>
            Sorry about I missed two weeks' blog, I have no reason or excuse for that, becuase I just forgot to do that.
            I seems like saying too much "I am sorry" these day. Yea, I understand that word "Don't be sorry, be
            better", but I just could not help myself.
            This week is very bad week for me. My girlfriend say goodbye to me, and it made me very sad.
            I could not control the tears, I could not stop the sad, it sucks.
            I missed the last class at Thursday. Acutally, I also "missed" the Tuesday class, becuase I did nothing.
            I did not help my teammate anything, I only could mute myself and cry like a coward.
        </p>

            Maybe I should not talk about my personal issue here, but I just don't know what to write.
            Ok, I can talk about my project1. I admit that I started it too late.
            I got the password problem again, that made me think about my past, and question myself "Did I make any big
            mistake?"
            I hope something good can happen next week. No, I could not be sad anymore.
            There must be something good happen next week! YES! I am sure!
